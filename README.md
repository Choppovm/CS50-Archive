# Choppovm-CS50-Archive
Archive of all of my work done on Harvard's CS50 course. 

*Private repo*; work here should not be publically accessible.

## Update - 8th September 2025
Repository is no longer private.

For individuals looking around here, please avoid directly copying code from here to your CS50 project (as staff will disqualify you if caught).

Small other thing. While I was taking the CS50 courses, I was only experienced in Python. Do not expect "good" code when it comes to other programming languages.
